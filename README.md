# Bamazon

The Bamazon application is an online storefront that allows customers to place their orders directly and aids store owners in managing their product inventory.

## For Customers

Customers can browse the store's entire inventory of products along with each product's stock quantity prior to placing an order. After browsing the inventory, the customer can select which item and the quantity they would like to purchase. If a customer attempts to purchase more items than that is available, the application will prevent the order from being placed. Otherwise, if there is sufficient quantity of the product to fulfill the customer's order, the order will be placed, the customer will be notified of the total cost of their order, and the store's inventory will be updated.

## For Store Managers

Using the Store Manager setting on the application allows managers to perform a few tasks: View Products for Sale, View Low Inventory, Add to Inventory, and Add New Product. Managers can select which of these actions they would like to take and the application will guide them through the processes. 

* View Products for Sale - Pulls up the store's entire inventory of products
* View Low Inventory - Pulls up a list of all products with a stock quantity of less than 5
* Add to Inventory - Allows managers to increase the stock quantites for products 
* Add New Product - Allows managers to add a new product to the store's inventory
